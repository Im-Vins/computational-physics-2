    "\n",
    "In programming, a **decorator** is a design pattern that adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is the first-order object. Thus, a decorator in Python adds additional responsibilities or functionalities to a function dynamically without modifying a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function can be passed as an argument to another function. It is also possible to define a function inside another function, and a function can return another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a decorator in Python is a function that receives another function as an argument. The behavior of the argument function is extended by the decorator without actually modifying it. The decorator function can be applied over a function using the **@decorator** syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure of decorators:\n",
    "The typical decorator function will look like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mydecoratorfunction(some_function): # decorator function\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def inner_function(): \n",
    "        # write code to extend the behavior of some_function()\n",
    "        some_function() # call some_function\n",
    "        # write code to extend the behavior of some_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "    return inner_function # return a wrapper function\n",
    "```\n",
