It is obtained by following a similar approach to the one we discussed in class. This method uses six points $k_1, k_2, k_3$, $k_4$, $k_5$, and $k_6$. A weighted average of these points is used to produce the approximation of the solution. The algorithm relies on computing the following slopes:\n",

Then, compute the $L_2$-norm errors for all these $15$ runs and report the results in a single figure with the $L_2$-norm errors in the Y axis and $h$ in the X axis. Which method produces the most accurate results?\n",

Then, create a python function that uses sympy to study the equilibrium populations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for a range of values of the natural death rate of the predator, $d$. The function should accept a range of $d$ values and return the equilibrium populations for all the $d$ values in the range. Ensure that the solutions are filtered to exclude extinction cases.\n",
