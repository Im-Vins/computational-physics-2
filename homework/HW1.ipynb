    "**(a)** Write down this system of ODEs in terms of the system state vector $S(t)$, i.e. $\\frac{dS}{dt} = F(S)$. Identify the slope function $F(S)$ and indicate whether or not it can be explicitly written as a function of $S$. Create a python function for the slope $F(S)$.\n",

    "**(d)** Write a python function for the **Butcher's Runge-Kutta method**, which is a popular method for integrating ODEs with a high order of accuracy. It is obtained by following a similar approach to the one we discussed in class. This method uses six points $k_1, k_2, k_3$, $k_4$, $k_5$, and $k_6$. A weighted average of these points is used to produce the approximation of the solution. The algorithm relies on computing the following slopes:\n",

    "### Python class:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Reorganise all your code from problem 1 into a single python class that contains attributes and methods. The settings and initial conditions should be attributes and all the python functions should become methods. Add a method to compute $L_2$-norm errors.\n",

    "### Error analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Call the methods from your python class above to run $15$ simulations ($5$ simulations per integration method) for $5$ decreasing values of the time step size, `dt` (i.e. $h$). Then, compute the $L_2$-norm errors for all these $15$ runs and report the results in a single figure with the $L_2$-norm errors in the Y axis and $h$ in the X axis. Which method produces the most accurate results?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equilibrium conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Write down the equilibrium condition for the system, $S(t)$. Then, create a python function that uses sympy to study the equilibrium populations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for a range of values of the natural death rate of the predator, $d$. The function should accept a range of $d$ values and return the equilibrium populations for all the $d$ values in the range. Ensure that the solutions are filtered to exclude extinction cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** After computing equilibrium solutions for multiple values of the predator mortality $d$, you should create a high-quality figure of the equilibrium populations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ (on the Y axis) versus $d$ (on the x-axis), and label what happens in the parameter regions outside of equilibrium conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Based on your analysis, for what range of $d$ values the system reaches equilibrium? What happens outside of that range? Call your class again to run and compare equilibrium versus extinction scenarios using $3$ different values of $d$.\n"

    "\n",
    "**(b)** Carefully read the tasks (c-g) below and design a suitable python class with attributes and methods that solves the above ODE using **the shooting method** with the slope computed in (a). You may use scipy integrators; there is no need to design your own integrators in this problem.\n",

    "### Tasks to be performed by your python class:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Find the **ground state energy** of the harmonic oscillator, to six significant digits, by using **the shooting method**. That is, solve the above equation numerically, varying $K$ until you get a wave function that goes to zero at large $\\xi$. The appropriate boundary conditions for the ground state (and any even state) are $\\psi(0) = 1$, $\\psi'(0) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Make a few illustrative panels showing plots of the wave function for different values of $K$ as it converges to the solution. What does the tail of the wave function does when the values are slightly above or below the correct solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Find the **first four excited state energies** (to six significant digits) for the harmonic oscillator, using **the shooting method**. For the first (and third) excited state you will need to set $\\psi(0) = 0$, $\\psi'(0) = 1$).\n",

    "**(f)** Make a few illustrative panels showing plots of the wave functions for different values of $K$ as they converge to their respective solutions.\n",

    "**(g)** Make a single plot showing the **harmonic potential** joinly with the **energy ladder** of the quantum harmonic oscillator (include the ground state plus the first four excited states that you calculated above, each with their **respective wave functions**). Consider the particle to be an electron and choose appropriate units for any physical parameters you may need."
